Feel free to look around the (messy) code or to self complie! Self compiling yourself should work out of the box if you follow the steps below


## Self Compiling an EXE for Windows
### Install
First clone this repository to your desktop and open it (e.g. with VS Code)

At the project root, do
```bash
$ npm install
```

### Build
Once it is installed, you can just build it
```bash
# For windows
$ npm run build:portable
```
A /dist folder would be created from the build, and the outputted Refern Capturer.exe should be in there.

Move the exe to your desktop or somewhere, and you should be good to go!
